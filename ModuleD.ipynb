        "**QR Decomposition** is a procedure used to solve the linear least squares problem where a matrix is broken down into two components, Q and R. The matrix A, which is to be decomposed, is transformed into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, A = Q * R. THe orthogonal matrix Q consists of columns that are orthogonal unit vectors while the upper triangular matrix R has all entries below the main diagonal as 0. The first step is to use the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to get an orthionormal basis span from a linearly independent set of span.\n",

        "The sytem Ax = b is often inconsistent. We want to try to use Ax to approximate b. So, we need an overdetermined system where n > m. But this matrix is not invertible. Therefore, the **Least-Squares** method works around this by looking for an approximate solution that reduces the distance between the projected data points and the actual data points."
